## Description

Welcome to the Snake Game â€“ a Python implementation of the classic game using the OpenCV library for rendering and game mechanics. Control a hungry snake, eat apples, grow longer, and enjoy a timeless gaming experience.

## Features

- Smooth and responsive snake movement controlled by arrow keys.
- Randomly placed apples for the snake to devour and extend its length.
- Real-time score tracking displayed on the screen.
- Engaging winning condition for players to strive for.
- Colorful and dynamic visuals, powered by OpenCV.
- No collision, so enjoy an immortal snake play.

## Demo

See the Snake Game in action:


## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/snake-game.git
   cd snake-game
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```sh
   pip install opencv-python imutils numpy
   ```

3. Run the game:

   ```sh
   python snake_game.py
   ```

## How to Play

- Use an object with the color scheme(I have used a green bottle cap if you have any other object, change the code accordingly).
- The snake grows in length when it consumes an apple.
- Avoid colliding with the screen boundaries or yourself.
- Reach the maximum score to achieve victory!
